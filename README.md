# OrdersProgram

This is a program I wrote to typing up my orders.  The medical record system that we use for writing our chart notes does not have an easy way for us to transmit our orders to the nursing home. 

You can add a census by copying the birthday report from Point Click Care to the program.  Just click on Creat New Census and there will be a text window.  Past in the birthday list from the Point Click Care report and then click Parse Data.  It will take you to the census display screen where you can save the census, add orders for a patient or make adjustments to the census.

Please note that this program will save a text file to the folder it is located in with facility census if you click on Save Census.  Check with your HIPPA compliance officer to confirm that this is appropriate given your IT configuration.  

Clicking on orders you will find a large text box where you can type your orders.  You will also find a number of buttons for preset orders.  These will be blank unless you have preset files from somewhere else.  To create your own preset first click on New Order.  Then type in a label for the order, the text of the order and click New Order again.  You then need to click Save in order to be able to have it available the next time you open the program.  To delete a preset order press the Delete Order button and then click on the order you want to remove.  Again, if you don't save it will not retain this for the next time you open the program.

Hitting the print button from the census screen creates a PDF file with your orders in it.  The PDF will be named Orders.pdf.  You can also fax this to the facility or send via some other messaging system if you preferr.
